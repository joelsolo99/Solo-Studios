Song
All of Me
All the Things you Are
As TIme Goes By
At Last
Autumn in New York
Autumn Leaves
Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered
Body and Soul
Bye Bye Blackbird
Cheek to Cheek
Desafinando
Flintstones
Fly me to the Moon
Georgia on my Mind
I Get a Kick out of You
It's Only a Paper Moon
Isn't she Lovely
Love for Sale
L.O.V.E
Mack the Knife
Misty
My Baby Just Cares for Me
New York New York
Orange Coloured Sky
Pick Yourself Up
Round Midnight
Someday my Prince will Come
Stompin' at the Savoy
Summertime
Take Five
Take the 'A' Train
The GIrl From Ipanema
The Lady is a Tramp
They Can't Take that Away From Me
That's Life
The Way You Look Tonight
When I Fall in Love
Work Song
You are the Sunshine of my Life
You Make me Feel so Young
